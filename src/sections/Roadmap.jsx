                And if we imagine man outside of civilization? What should he be like, not having all the benefits of humanity? Left alone in the wilderness?  We called our project "The Chameleon Man". It is a creature ready to change under any conditions, to react to the weather, to fight danger, or to dissolve among the world around him...

                Our Art Collection is created from a  variety of alien characters, in the form of a fusion of man and animal. Each character has its own unique design and purpose. The release of our art will take place one at a time. First one animal fusion, then another. This way we can create our art much more interesting and varied.

                The first launch of ArtTeam's NFT collection of 1,500 artâ€™s is designed as a human chameleon. Each 3D image has its own unique design and value. This character changes skin color, adjusting to any environment. Gradients are also designed with other animal colors. For example, the coloration of a zebra or cheetah. Such NFT images are considered very rare and unique. Whoever gets the chance to buy such NFT is considered really lucky. In the future, such art will increase in value by hundreds of times.

                In the near future our ArtTeam plans to create their own metaverse. Characters which you purchased will also be used as skins in our virtual world. There you will also be able to mine tokens, buy housing and create your own landscaping. Lots of cool shenanigans, contests, and good cheer await you in our new meta universe.<br/><br/>Follow us on social media so you don't miss out.
